.SH NAME
_printf

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"

int _printf("Hello World!");

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf() produces given output to the standard output stream. Data for output can be given by enclosing text within quotes and using special characters such as %i to tell the function. _printf writes the output under a format that specifies how arguments and special characters are to be converted for the output.

.SH FORMAT
When a string is given, the string is copying every character (excluding %) to the standard output stream. Conversion Specificiers are added by the % sign and end by the conversion specifier, which is a letter. The converion occurs causing the specifiers to be replaced with the correpsonding variables passed in. 

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS

d, i: The int argument is converted to decimal notation. Using i specifies the function to get a varaible and print it of type integer. 

o, u, x, X: The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x,X). abcdef are used for (x) while (X) takes ABCDEF.

c: The argument given is converted from an Integer to an unsigned char and the result will be put into the output. 

s: Copies from the variable given all the way to the null byte character ('\0').

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon a successful return, this function will return the numbers of chars printed to the screen excluding the NULL byte.
